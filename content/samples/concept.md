*Flows* are conversational processes that represent interactions between users and virtual agents. Flows outline the various paths a conversation can take and define the logic that determines the virtual agent's responses. By using flows, you can customize and design the behavior of virtual agents to create tailored and dynamic conversational experiences.

## Use Cases for Flows

- Handling common customer inquiries, troubleshooting issues, and providing assistance.
- Providing information about products or services, answering FAQs, and guiding users through purchasing processes.
- Assisting users in completing tasks, such as scheduling appointments, making reservations, or filling out forms.
- Gathering information from users, such as surveys, feedback, or personal details.

## Key Components of Flows

### Intents

The user's intent is the underlying meaning or goal behind their utterance. Intents help the virtual agent understand the user's request.

### Entities

Entities are specific pieces of information extracted from the user's input, such as names, dates, or locations.

### Nodes

Nodes represent specific steps in the conversation, where the virtual agent can process user input, make decisions, and generate responses.

## How Flows Work

1. The user sends a message to the virtual agent.
2. The virtual agent analyzes the user's input to determine the intent.
3. Relevant entities are extracted from the user's input.
4. The virtual agent follows the flow based on the recognized intent and extracted entities.
5. The virtual agent generates a response, which can be a simple text message or a more complex response involving multiple steps or external integrations.
