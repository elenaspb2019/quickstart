<h3 id="intents">Intents</h3>
<p>The user&rsquo;s intent is the underlying meaning or goal behind their utterance. Intents help the virtual agent understand the user&rsquo;s request.</p>
<h3 id="entities">Entities</h3>
<p>Entities are specific pieces of information extracted from the user&rsquo;s input, such as names, dates, or locations.</p>
<h3 id="nodes">Nodes</h3>
<p>Nodes represent specific steps in the conversation, where the virtual agent can process user input, make decisions, and generate responses.</p>
<h2 id="how-flows-work">How Flows Work</h2>
<ol>
<li>The user sends a message to the virtual agent.</li>
<li>The virtual agent analyzes the user&rsquo;s input to determine the intent.</li>
<li>Relevant entities are extracted from the user&rsquo;s input.</li>
<li>The virtual agent follows the flow based on the recognized intent and extracted entities.</li>
<li>The virtual agent generates a response, which can be a simple text message or a more complex response involving multiple steps or external integrations.</li>
</ol>
